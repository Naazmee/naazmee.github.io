			<h3>Abdominal and Inguinal Hernia Repair</h3>
			<h6>Overview</h6>
			<p style="text-align: justify">
The abdominal and inguinal hernia is the formation of a balloon-like sac at a location, where anterior abdominal wall muscles and membranes weaken. The weakness of the abdominal wall may be secondary to aging, factors that increase the intraabdominal pressure (heavy lifting, coughing, straining etc.), weakness of the abdominal wall in infants and children, and the deformation of the abdominal wall anatomy due to incision, pregnancy and trauma.</p>

			<h3>Abdominoplasty (Tummy Tuck)</h3>
			<h6>Overview</h6>
			<p style="text-align: justify">
			  Abdominoplasty is a surgical procedure that aims to have abdomen look better.<br>
Sequential weight gain and loss and genetic features lead to various deformities in the abdominal region. Apart from these, especially pregnancy can also cause a deformity due to relaxation of abdominal muscles and loss of skin tone.<br>
If your abdominal skin has lost its flexibility and sags, abdominoplasty is performed to remove excess skin and fats. </p>

			<h3>Aortic Valve Repair and Replacement</h3>
		    <h6>Overview</h6>
			<p style="text-align: justify"> Aortic valve replacement surgery is an open heart surgery to replace the aortic valve. Surgery is performed for stenosis and insufficiency of the aortic valve.
The aortic valve is the heart valve located between the left ventricle (ventricle) and the aorta â€“ the major artery of our body. It opens when the oxygen-rich blood is pumped from the heart to the body, and closes when the blood is pumped from the left atrium to the left ventricle.
If you have aortic valve disease, you might not have any symptoms at the initial stage. However, the disease progresses over time and starts causing the following symptoms. </p>

			<h3>Arm Lift</h3>
			<h6>Overview</h6>
			<p style="text-align: justify">
Deterioration of the skin thickness and elasticity is inevitable due to many factors, especially aging and weight gain and loss. As the person ages, the elastic and collagen fibers in the body becomes distorted and deformed and subcutaneous fat tissue shrinks. Accordingly, body tissues loosen and sag.<br>

If the skin of arms sags, the condition can be corrected by arm lift, also known as brachioplasty. Excess skin and fat in undersides of your arm are removed, sagging is eliminated and the skin is stretched to obtain a toned appearance by arm lift.<br>

If you want to have an arm lift, please consult our plastic surgeons for techniques, expectations, conditions that contraindicate arm lift and potential risks.</p>

			<h3>Bone Marrow & Stem Cell Transplant</h3>
			 <h6>Overview</h6>
			<p style="text-align: justify">
			 Bone marrow is the tissue responsible for the production of blood cells in our body. Blood has three types of cells; red blood cells that transport oxygen into organs and tissues, white blood cells that act in defense of the body against external factors, and platelets for clotting the blood. Cells responsible for the production of blood cells in the bone marrow are referred to as hematopoietic progenitor cells. In other words, the purpose of bone marrow transplantation is to transfer the stem cell, which is responsible for the production of other cells. </p>

			<h3> Brain Cancer</h3>
		<h6>Overview</h6>
			<p style="text-align: justify">Brain cancer or tumor is a lump that forms due to abnormal division and accumulation of cells in brain.<br>
There are various series of cells in the brain. A wide range of tumors that originate from these cells are either benign or malignant in nature.<br>

As is the case with all cancers, tumors originating from native cells of the brain are called primary tumor. Secondary or metastatic brain tumor implies a tumor that develops in another organ or tissue and spreads to the brain. </p>

			<h3> Breast Augmentation</h3>
			<h6>Overview</h6>
			<p style="text-align: justify">
Breast augmentation is a surgical procedure to enlarge the breast.<br>
In breast augmentation surgery, a breast implant is placed underneath the mammary tissue or under the muscles of the rib cage to achieve the desired size of the breast.<br>
If there are problems with the appearance of the breast along with the size, a mastopexy (breast lift) and other reconstructive operations can be done in the same session.<br> 
If you want to have your breast(s) augmented, please consult our plastic surgeons for techniques, expectations, potential risks, size of implant and shape of breast.<br>

			<h3>Breast Lift</h3>
			 <h6>Overview</h6>
			<p style="text-align: justify">
			 BBreast lift, also known as mastopexy, is an operation to correct the appearance of breast(s) that sag due to loss of elasticity secondary to many factors, including but not limited to aging, hormonal factors, pregnancy, breastfeeding, genetics and weight gain and loss.<br>

In order to lift the breast, the excess skin is removed and the ligaments that suspend the breast are repaired. The breast and the surrounding supportive tissues are reshaped, volume of the breast is enhanced and the breast is lifted, resulting in natural conic form.<br>

If you feel that your breast(s) sag or if your nipple is located below the inframammary fold or points downward, you may consider a breast lift.</p>

			<h3> Breast Cancer</h3>
		<h6>Overview</h6>
			<p style="text-align: justify">Breast is an organ that is formed by three types of tissues, namely adipose tissues, connective tissue and secretory glands; breasts produce milk and enable breastfeeding in women, but, they are rather premature and dysfunctional in men. There is a major milk duct that runs to the nipple at the middle zone of each breast. Smaller ducts of mammary lobes drain to the major duct, usually just before the nipple. A breast lobe is formed by lobules that contain milk-producing glands.

			<h3> Cancer Surgery</h3>
				<h6>Overview</h6>
			<p style="text-align: justify">Cancer is a condition that is characterized by abnormally growth and division of cells and ability to live when healthy cells die. Continuous growth and division lead to accumulation of those abnormal cells, resulting in formation of a mass or a lump.<br>

Primary cancer implies cancers that originate from tissues or cells of an organ, while metastatic cancer refers a cancer that develops in a particular organ or tissue and spreads to nearby or distant organs.<br>

Cancer surgery points out the operative removal of the tumor that has developed in various organs or tissues of the body.</p>

			<h3> Capsule Endoscopy</h3>
			<h6>Overview</h6>
			<p style="text-align: justify">
				
Endoscopy is now too easy thanks to the capsule endoscopy that is used to identify diseases of small intestine and colon. "Capsule endoscopy", one of the newest methods used to examine ulcers, polyps, cancer or other abnormal formations located in small intestines and colon, is the most advanced technology.</p>

			<h3>Cardiac Angioplasty and Stent</h3>
			 <h6>Overview</h6>
			<p style="text-align: justify">
				
			Coronary angioplasty, also known as percutaneous coronary intervention, balloon angioplasty and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, is used to open the clogged heart vessels (coronary arteries).<br>

A catheter is usually inserted into an artery in the groin area and advanced to the clogged segment of the coronary artery tree. A plan is made by using the images. Afterwards, a balloon is advanced over the catheter and inflated at the clogged part. Thus, the occlusion is opened and blood flow is restored.<br>
